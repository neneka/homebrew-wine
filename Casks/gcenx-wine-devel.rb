    caveats <<~EOS
        #{token} supports both 32-bit and 64-bit now. It is compatible with your
        existing 32-bit wine prefix, but it will now default to 64-bit when you
        create a new wine prefix. The architecture can be selected using the
          WINEARCH environment variable which can be set to either win32 or
        win64.
      
        To create a new pure 32-bit prefix, you can run:
            $ WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine32 winecfg
        See the Wine FAQ for details: https://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ#Wineprefixes

    caveats <<~EOS
        To enable noflicker set the following registry key in your prefix:
        [HKCU\\Software\\Wine\\Mac Driver]
        "ForceOpenGLBackingStore"="y"
    EOS
